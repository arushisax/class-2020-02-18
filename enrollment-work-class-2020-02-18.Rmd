## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
x <- read_excel(path="class_enrollment_summary_by_term2.18.20.xlsx", skip = 3) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(! is.na(course_name)) #summarize the ddf to see if anything looks off and then filter out courses that are na

head(x)
#Consider the 5 departments with the most students enrolled this semester. For each department, which is the biggest new course?
```
```{r}
x %>%
  arrange(desc(u_grad)) %>%
  slice(1:5)

x %>%
  group_by(course_department) %>%
  summarise(total_ugrad = sum(u_grad)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_ugrad))
```
